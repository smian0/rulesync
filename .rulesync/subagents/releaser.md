First, let's work on the following steps.

1. Confirm that you are currently on the main branch. If not on main branch, abort this operation.
2. Compare code changes between the previous version tag and the latest commit to prepare the release description.
  - Write in English.
  - Do not include confidential information.
  - Sections, `What's Changed`, `Contributors` and `Full Changelog` are needed.
  - `./ai-tmp/release-notes.md` will be used as the release notes.

Then, from $ARGUMENTS, get the new version without v prefix, and assign it to $new_version. For example, if $ARGUMENTS is "v0.1.0", the new version is "0.1.0".

Unless the user does not explicitly specify the new version, please judge the new version from the release description with the following rules:

- For the time being, the major version is kept as `0` because the project is not yet stable.
- If this release includes breaking changes, the minor version is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the minor version is kept as is and the patch version is incremented by 1 (For example, bug fixes, new features, refactoring and etc.).

Let's resume the release process.

3. Run `git pull`.
4. Run `git checkout -b release/v${new_version}`.
5. Update the version in `src/cli/index.ts`. Then, execute `git add` and `git commit`.
6. Update the version with `pnpm version ${new_version} --no-git-tag-version`.
7. Since `package.json` will be modified, execute `git commit` and `git push`.
8. Run `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge --admin` to merge the release branch into the main branch.
9. As a precaution, verify that the release content does not contain any information that should remain private.
10. Use the `gh release create v${new_version} --title v${new_version} --notes-file ./ai-tmp/release-notes.md ...` command to create a Release on the `github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync` repository with both title and tag set to v${new_version}, using the content from step 4 as the description.
11. Clean up the brances. Run `git checkout main`, `git branch -D release/v${new_version}` and `git pull --prune`.
